Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, often resulting from undiagnosed or poorly monitored risk factors such as high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and sedentary lifestyles. Traditional heart risk assessment methods typically require clinical visits and expensive diagnostic equipment, limiting continuous health monitoring. Recent advancements in wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices have enabled real-time, non-invasive collection of vital health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and physical activity levels.
This project aims to leverage machine learning (ML) classifiers to assess heart risk levels based on data collected from wearable IoT devices. By integrating ML models with wearable technology, the system can continuously analyze physiological signals and predict potential heart health risks, enabling early intervention and personalized healthcare. The proposed solution offers a scalable, cost-effective, and user-friendly approach to proactive cardiac health monitoring, with potential applications in remote health care, fitness monitoring, and preventive medicine.
